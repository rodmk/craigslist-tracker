Craigslist Tracker
=========

Craigslist tracker is a simple application that tracks a search (or searches) on craigslist and shoots an e-mail whenever a new posting is found.

This project requires Python and Scrapy (see: http://scrapy.org/) to run. You must first set up the proper configuration (set it in rename_to_config.yml and rename to config.yml). Then, run cragislist_start_tracking.sh in the background, sit back, and enjoy.
